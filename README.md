# Battleships

A ongoing project of building a game of battleships by [Richard Hpa](https://github.com/RichardHpa) and [Ash Rockett](https://github.com/MrAshRockett)

## Rules of Battleships

Each player receives a game board and five ships of varying lengths. Each ship has holes where the "hit" pegs are inserted and a supply of hit and miss markers (white and red pegs). The five ships are:

Carrier, which has five holes
Battleship, which has four holes
Cruiser, which has three holes
Submarine, which has three holes
Destroyer, which has two holes

Before the game starts, each opponent secretly places their own five ships on the ocean grid (lower part of the board) by laying out their ships and anchoring them into the holes on the grid. Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces—not diagonally—and the ships can't hang off the grid. Ships can touch each other, but they can't occupy the same grid space. You cannot change the position of the ships after the game begins.

Players take turns firing shots (by calling out a grid coordinate) to attempt to hit the opponent's enemy ships.
